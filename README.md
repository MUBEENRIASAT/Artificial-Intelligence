# Artificial-Intelligence
Here my AI course certification.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines or software that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.
The main goal of AI is to "think like human" and "act like human".
but still it not possible.
AI is used in everyday life in things like smartphones, self-driving cars, virtual assistants (like Siri or Alexa), and even in healthcare and education.
